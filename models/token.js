	There are a couple of interesting points regarding our verification tokens
		*	Not surprisingly, you will need to provide the userId of the user the token is issued

		*	There is a feature in Mongo called "expires" that sets a document TTL.  Here
			the TTL is set to 43200 or 12 hours.  Then the verification token expires.
